ðŸŒ¸ Flower Recognition Web App ðŸŒ¸

This project is a web application that classifies images of flowers using a deep learning model. Built with Django and TensorFlow, it can identify five types of flowers: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. The model is trained using Keras and provides accurate classification results.

## Features:
- Upload flower images for classification.
- The model predicts the type of flower with a confidence score.
- User-friendly, dark-themed interface.
